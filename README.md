# THERMAID
A numerical code to solve flow and heat transport in fractured porous media by the embedded discrete fracture method

**Important note:** *Our documentation is currently under construction. Please don't hesistate to contact the author's directly should any questions arise.*

What is Thermaid?
------------------

THERMAID is short for *Thermo-Hydraulic Energy Resource Modelling for Application and Development* and is a MATLAB program solving flow and heat transport in fractured porous media using the embedded discrete fracture method. It is targeted at researchers in the field of subsurface simulations who want to investigate energy resources in the subsurface and understand the embedded discrete fracture model.



For the impatient:
------------------

Download or clone the THERMAID repository. If you downloaded the repository as .zip or .tar.gz unpack it.

Let's say you've stored everything in a directory /path/to/THERMAID. 
Then you can run and test the program by opening matlab and running:

    >> cd /path/to/THERMAID
    >> cd examples/
    >> ex1

If this gives you an error message try to execute the startup script manually:

    >> startup

Then start MATLAB and continue as before.

Detailed instructions can be found in the quick start guide.
